User Instructions for the Prototype
#########################################

In general, every step is only possible if all previous mandatory fields are validly filled.
A graph database can only be used, which meets the structural requirements, such our provided graph datadbase.

1) Select Data Set
	- click "Open"-Button
	- select the graph database directory in the file selection dialog

2) Select Guide Sequence
	- select a genome from the list
	- select a sub-structure from the list
	- define a selection range with the start and end coordinates (must be within the specified limits)
	- setting a length filter in the corresponding text field
		--> alignment blocks with a length below this threshold are filtered out (setting the value to 1, disables the length filter)

3) Load Guide Sequence from the Database
	- click "Load Guide Sequence"-Button
		--> this provides the possible comparative sequences from the database in a tree view

4) Select Comparative Sequences
	- select comparative sequences in the tree view
		--> selected comparative sequences are listed in the selection order in the table beside -- representing the genome order

5) Creating Graph Layout
	- click "Show Graph"-Button
	
Additional Layout Options:

1) Join
	- if "Join"-Checkbox is selected --> merged alignment blocks are allowed
	- must be set before clicking "Show Graph"-Button

2) Thickness Factor
	- determines the thickness of the edges
	- must be set before clicking "Show Graph"-Button

3) Space Factor
	- together with the thickness factor determines the free space between the edges
	- must be set before clicking "Show Graph"-Button

4) Snapshot
	- click "Snapshot"-Button --> save the drawn graph layout to a png-file
	
5) Color Coding of the Sequences
	- all sequences have their own Checkbox in the list
	- if a checkbox is selected --> the edges of the selected sequence are drawn in the assigned color
	- "Show Graph"-Button does not need to be clicked again
