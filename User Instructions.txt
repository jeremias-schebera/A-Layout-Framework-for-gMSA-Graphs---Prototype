In general, the following step is only possible if all previous mandatory fields are validly filled.
Only one graph database can be used, which meets the structural requirements, such as the data set:

1) Select Data Set
	- click "Open"-Button
	- select a graph database in the file selection dialog

2) Select Guide Sequence
	- select a genome from the list
	- select a sub-structure from the list
	- define a selection range with the start and end coordinates (must be within the specified limits)
	- setting a length filter in the corresponding text field
		--> alignment blocks with a length below this threshold are filtered out (setting the value to 1, disables the length filter)

3) Load Guide Sequence from the Database
	- click "Load Guide Sequence"-Button
		--> this provides the possible comparative sequences from the database in a tree view

4) Select Comparative Sequences
	- select comparative sequences in the tree view
		--> selected comparative sequences are listed in the selection order in the table beside -- representing the genome order

5) Creating Graph Layout
